	<h1>Meetings</h1>
	<p>
	  We have weekly lectures Wednesday mornings from 10-10:50 AM
	  in 100 Broad.  On Mondays, you may attend one of the two lab
	  sessions, either 1-4pm or 7-10pm, both in 328 SFL.
	  Bring your laptop and charger.  You should always attend the
	  same lab session (either 1pm or 7pm), unless you have a
	  conflict and let the course instructors know.</p>

	<br />

	<p>
	  Attendance at lecture and participation in lab sessions are
	  mandatory; 20% of your grade depends on it.
	</p>
	<br />

    <h1>Lab sessions</h1>
          <p>In each three-hour lab session, you are expected to actively work through the
              tutorials with the instructors.  As such, you will
              be writing live code in a <font style="font-family:courier">.py</font> file.
              This file must be emailed to <b><font style="font-family:courier">bebi103 at caltech dot edu</font></b>
              at the end of each lab session to get credit for attendance in the lab session.
              The subject line of the email should be
          </p>

	<h1>Homework</h1>
	<p>Homework will be assigned roughly weekly.  The homework
	  assignments will typically have one or two short questions
	  about the theory behind the analysis featured in the problem
	  set, but will mainly consist of actually working up real (and
	  in some rare cases contrived) data.</p>
	<br />
	<p> Data analysis is almost always a collaborative effort in
	  both research and industry.  Therefore, you will be assigned
	  to groups of three (possibly with a couple groups of four
	  depending on course enrollment).  You will submit your
	  homework as a group.  The following homework policies
	  apply.</p>
	<br />
	<ul class="publist">
	  <li>Each homework will have a defined due date and time,
	    usually at the beginning of class.  Late homeworks are
	    accepted with a 10% deduction for every day they are
	    late.  For example, if the homework is due at 1pm on
	    Monday, and you turn it in late but before 1pm on
	    Tuesday, your maximum score will be 90%.  You may not
	    work on late homework during class.</li>
    <li>Each homework <i>problem </i> must be submitted as single Jupyter
	    notebook.  Its file name must be
        <b><font style="font-family:courier">group#_hw#_prob#.ipynb</font></b>,
        where the first <font style="font-family:courier">#</font> symbol is replaced by your assigned group number.
        The subsequent <font style="font-family:courier">#</font> symbols are replaced with the
        obvious values.  The notebooks comprising the homework should be zipped into
        a single file named <b><font style="font-family:courier">group#_hw#.ipynb</font></b>.
        Your notebook must be emailed to
        <b><font style="font-family:courier">bebi103 at caltech dot edu</font></b>
        ahead of the due time.  The subject line of the email should be the
        same as the file name, minus the <font style="font-family:courier">.ipynb</font> suffix.</li>
    <li>All code you wrote to do your assignment must be included in the notebook.
        Code from imported packages that you did not write (e.g., modules
        distributed by the class instructors) need not be displayed in the notebook.
        We will run the code in your notebook; all code must run to get credit.
	  </li>
	<li>All of your results must be clearly explained and all
	    graphics clearly presented and embedded in the Jupyter
	    notebook.</li>
	<li>Any mathematics in your homework must render clearly and
	    properly with MathJax.  This essentially means that your
	    equations must be written in correct LaTeX.</li>
	  <li>You should also include attribution in your homework
	    submission: who in the group did what.  While different
	    people in the group may do different parts of the
	    homework, I encourage you to work together on all parts of
	    the homework.  At the very least, <i>you personally must
	    understand all of the steps taken in the homework
	    solutions and be able to repeat them by
	    yourself.</i></li>
	  <li>Where appropriate, you need to give detailed discussion
	    of analysis choices you have made.  As an example, you may
	    choose to use wavelets to denoise temporal data instead of
	    a Gaussian filter.  You need to justify that choice.</li>
	  <li>There is seldom a single right way to analyze a set of
	    data.  You are encouraged to try different approaches to
	    analysis.  If you perform an analysis and find problems
	    with it, clearly write what the problems are and how they
	    came about.  Even if your analysis does not completely
	    work, but you demonstrate that you thought carefully about
	    it and understand its difficulties, you will get nearly
	    full credit.</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Grading</h1>
	<p>80% of your grade is determined from homework.  Everyone in
	your group will get the same grade on the homework.</p><br />

	<p>20% of your grade is determined from participation in the
	lab sessions.  You are expected to work together with the
	course instructors and fellow students as we go through the
	tutorials with your full attention.</p><br />

	<h1>Collaboration policy and Honor Code</h1>
	<p>Most importantly, much of the data we will use in this
	course is unpublished, generously given to us by researchers
	both from Caltech and from other institutions.  They have
	given us their data in good faith that it will be used only in
	this class.  <b>It is therefore imperative that you do not
	disseminate the data sets anywhere outside of this
	class.</b></p><br />

	<p>Since the homework is done in assigned groups, you
	obviously should collaborate heavily with the other members of
	your group.  You are free to discuss the homework with other
	groups, including via <a href="https://piazza.com/caltech/fall2015/bebi103/home">Piazza</a>, but the work you submit must be the work of your own
	group.</p><br />

	<p>You may not consult solutions of homework problems from
	previous editions of this course.
	</p><br />

	<p>You are free to consult references, literature, websites,
	blogs, etc., outside of the materials presented in class (the
	obvious exceptions being last year's homework solutions).  In
	fact, you are encouraged to do so.  If you do, you must
	properly cite the sources in your homework.  Be
	warned: <i>doing homework by Google fishing will not work!</i>
	The problems are too open ended and the techniques are too
	varied.</p><br />

	<h1>Excused absenses/extensions</h1>
	<p>Under certain circumstances, missed lab or lecture sessions
	will be excused and extensions given on the homework.  The
	reasons for the excuses or extensions must be compelling, such
	as health or family issues.  They must be requested from the
	course instructor.</p><br />

    <h1>Course communications</h1>
          <p>You are free to contact the <a href="people.html">course staff</a> at any time,
          but we encourage you to use the
          <a href="https://piazza.com/caltech/fall2015/bebi103/home">class Piazza page</a>
          for questions course topics and homework.  Most of our mass communication with
          you will be through Piazza, so be sure to set your Piazza account to give
          you email alerts if necessary.</p>

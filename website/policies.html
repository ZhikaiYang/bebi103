	<h1>Meetings</h1>
	<p>
	  We have weekly lectures Wednesday mornings from 10-10:50 AM
	  in 100 Broad.  On Mondays, you may attend one of the two lab
	  sessions, either 1-4pm or 7-10pm, both in 100 Broad.
	  Bring your laptop and charger, since all seats have power
	  outlets.  You should always attend the same lab session
	  (either 1pm or 7pm), unless you have a conflict and let the
	  course instructors know.</p>

	<br />

	<p>
	  Attendance at lecture and participation in lab sessions are
	  mandatory; 20% of your grade depends on it.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h1>Homework</h1>
	<p>Homework will be assigned roughly weekly.  Each homework
	will have a defined due date and time, usually at the
	beginning of class.  Late homeworks are accepted with a 10%
	deduction for every day they are late.  For example, if the
	homework is due at 1pm on Monday, and you turn it in late but
	before 1pm on Tuesday, your maximum score will be 90%.  You
	may not work on late homework during class.

	The homework assignments will typically have one or two short
	questions about the theory behind the analysis featured in the
	problem set, but will mainly consist of actually working up
	real (and in some cases contrived) data.  Where appropriate,
	you need to give detailed discussion of analysis choices you
	have made.  As an example, you may choose to use wavelets to
	denoise temporal data instead of a Gaussian filter.  You need
	to justify that choice.</p><br />

	<p>Any problem that requires coding must be done in Python
	(unless specifically indicated otherwise), and the original
	code must be submitted by email to all three of the course
	instructors.  The code must be clearly written and well
	commented.  The TAs will run the code: <i>it must work to
	receive full credit!</i></p><br />

	<p>Data analysis is almost always a collaborative effort in
	both research and industry.  Therefore, you will be assigned
	to groups of three (possibly with a couple groups of two
	depending on course enrollment).  You will submit your
	homework as a group.  You should also include attribution in
	your homework submission: who in the group did what.  While
	different people in the group may do different parts of the
	homework, I encourage you to work together on all parts of the
	homework.  At the very least, <i>you personally must
	understand all of the steps taken in the homework solutions
	and be able to repeat them by yourself.</i></p><br />

	<h1>Grading</h1>
	<p>80% of your grade is determined from homework.  Everyone in
	your group will get the same grade on the homework.</p><br />

	<p>20% of your grade is determined from participation in the
	lab sessions.  You are expected to work together with the
	course instructors and fellow students as we go through the
	tutorials with your full attention.</p><br />
	
	<h1>Honor Code</h1> 
	<p>Since the homework is done in assigned groups, you
	obviously should collaborate heavily with the other members of
	your group.  You are free to discuss the homework with other
	groups, but the work you submit must be the work of your own
	group.</p><br />

	<p>You are free to consult references, literature, websites,
	blogs, etc., outside of the materials presented in class.  In
	fact, you are encouraged to do so.  If you do, you must
	properly cite the sources in your homework.  Be warned: <i>doing
	homework by Google fishing will not work!</i>  The problems are
	too open ended and the techniques are too varied.</p><br />

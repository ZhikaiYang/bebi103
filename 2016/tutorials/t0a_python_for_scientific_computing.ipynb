    "\n",
    "There are two main ways people set up Python for scientific computing.\n",
    "1. By downloading and installing package by package with tools like [apt-get](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto), [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/), etc.\n",
    "2. By downloading and installing a Python distribution that contains binaries of many of the scientific packages needed. The major distributions of these are [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) and [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/). Both contain IDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will use Anaconda, with its associated package manager, `conda`. It has recently become the de facto package manager/distribution for scientific use."

    "## Python 2 vs Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "We are at an interesting point in Python's history.  Python is currently in version 3.5 (as of September 20, 2016). The problem is that Python 3.x is not backwards compatible with Python 2.x.  Many scientific packages were written in Python 2.x and have been very slow to update to Python 3.  However, Python 3 is Python's present and future, so all packages eventually need to work in Python 3.  Today, most important scientific packages work in Python 3.  All of the packages we will use do, so we will use Python 3 in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you who are already using Anaconda with Python 2, you can [create a Python 3 environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/py2or3.html#create-python-2-or-3-environments)."

If you are using Linux, it's a good bet you already know how to navigate a terminal, so we will not give specific instructions for Linux.  For a Mac, you can fire up the Terminal application.  It is typically in the `/Applications/Utilities` folder.  Otherwise, hold down Command `âŒ˜`-space bar and type \"terminal\" in the search box, and select the Terminal Application.\n",

    "For Windows, download and install [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io).  After you have installed it, simply right click anywhere on your Desktop, and you should have an option to run Git Bash (at least that's what happens on Windows 7).  You will then have a prompt that looks very much like Mac and Linux users will have."

    "## The `conda` package manager\n",
    "`conda` is a package manager for keeping all of your packages up-to-date.  It has plenty of functionality beyond our basic usage in class, which you can learn more about by reading the [docs](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/get-started.html).  We will primarily be using `conda` to install and update packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda` works from the command line.  Now that you know how to get a command line prompt, you can start using `conda`.  The first thing we'll do is update `conda` itself.  To do this, enter the following on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda update conda\n",
    "\n",
    "If `conda` is out of date and needs to be updated, you will be prompted to perform the update.  Just type `y`, and the update will proceeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that `conda` is updated, we'll use it to see what packages are installed.  Type the following on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda list\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a list of all packages and their versions that are installed.  Now, we'll update all packages, so type the following on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda update --all\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be prompted to perform all of the updates.  They may even be some downgrades.  This happens when there are package conflicts where one package requires an earlier version of another.  `conda` is very smart and figures all of this out for you, so you can almost always say \"yes\" (or \"`y`\") to `conda` when it prompts you."

    "## The Atom text editor\n",
    "\n",
    "For almost the entirely of the course, we will do all work in [Jupyter notebooks](t0b_intro_to_jupyter_notebooks.html). This is not the best workflow for larger projects. It is better to have separate Python scripts. Furthermore, you might want to be building your own module of useful utilities for the course, which will be written using text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countless options for text editors. For example, Anaconda comes with an **interactive developer environment** (IDE) called [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/), which is built for scientific computing. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) is a widely used text editor. I have happily used [Light Table](http://lighttable.com) in the past. At the moment, I recommend using [Atom](https://atom.io), which is currently my own text editor of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To download and install Atom, go to [its website](https://atom.io) and follow the instructions. Once it's installed, you have a good text editor to use in the bootcamp and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default configuration of Atom will work well for you, but you have to be careful with how tabs are defined. In the Atom menu, go to\n",
    "\n",
    "    Packages -> Settings View -> Open\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open the Settings page for Atom. Scroll toward the bottom of that page, and make sure `Tab Length` is set to 4. Underneath that, make sure `Tab Type` is set to `soft`. As you will soon learn, this is important in Python because indentation matters."

To do this, see [this tutorial](http://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2016/lessons/l11_version_control_with_git.html) from my Intro to Programming Bootcamp.\n",

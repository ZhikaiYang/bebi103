    "This homework is to be done individually, not in groups. Your responses are not to be put in your GitHub account so you can speak candidly without the influence of your teammates. You do not need to use a Jupyter notebook to do the problem.  Instead, you should submit your responses either as a PDF or just as text in an email. Do not submit a MS Word document. Please email your responses to `bebi103 at caltech dot edu` **and** to `bois at caltech dot edu`.\n",

It used to be the case that during these sessions we would work through the tutorials together, but we thought that having you start your homework having done the tutorials by yourself would be much more productive. Do you think you took advantage of these sessions with this format? Do you have any suggestions for improvement of these sessions?\n",

    "### Problem 8.1: Pulsing jellyfish (60 pts)\n",
    "In [Tutorial 8a](http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2016/protected/tutorials/t8a_extracting_info_from_images.html), we extracted information from movies of pulsing jellyfish. Using these images (which you can download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mbz2gfnnwefdto2/cassiopea_pulsation.zip?dl=0)), analyze both the daytime and nighttime movies.  Compare and contrast the measurements both between daytime and nighttime and among the individual jellyfish.  Discuss any conclusions or suggestions for further experiments you may have.\n",

    "\n",
    "With your new image processing skills, you can start to work on more complicated images.  For this problem, you will analyze a FRAP experiment and then perform parameter estimation to determine a diffusion coefficient and a binding rate for two molecules.  We will be taking a simplified approach, but there is more sophisticated analysis we can do to get better estimates for the phenomenological coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set comes from [Nate Goehring](https://goehringlab.crick.ac.uk).  The images are taken of a *C. elegans* one-cell embryo expressing a GFP fusion to the PH domain of Protein Lipase C delta 1 (PH-PLCd1).  This domain binds PIP2, a lipid enriched in the plasma membrane.  By using FRAP, we can investigate the dynamics of diffusion of the PH-PLCd1/PIP2 complex on the cell membrane, as well as the binding/unbinding dynamics of PH-PLCd1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if $c$ is the concentration of the PH-PLDd1/PIP2 complex on the membrane and $c_\\mathrm{cyto}$ is the concentration of PH-PLCd1 in the cytoplasm (assumed to be spatially uniform since diffusion in the cytoplasm is very fast), the dynamics are described by a reaction-diffusion equation.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $k_\\mathrm{on}$ and $k_\\mathrm{off}$ are the phenomenological rate constants for binding and unbinding to PIP2 on the membrane, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient for the PH-PLCd1/PIP2 complex on the membrane.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [their paper](http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2015/protected/papers/goehring_2010.pdf), the authors discuss techniques for analyzing the data taking into account the fluorescence recovery of the bleached region in time and space.  For simplicity here, we will only consider recovery of the normalized mean fluorescence.  If $I(t)$ is the mean fluorescence of the bleached region and $I_0$ is the mean fluorescence of the bleached region immediately before photobleaching, we have, as derived in the paper,\n",

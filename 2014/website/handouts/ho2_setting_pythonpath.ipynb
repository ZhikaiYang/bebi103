      "The `PYTHONPATH` [environment variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) lets Python know where to look for files when using `import`.  For a default Canopy installation on Mac OS X, it may look something like this (all on a single line):\n",

      "If you write your own module, Python will find it, so long as you are running Python in the same directory as the module (`./`).  But this can be cumbersome and inconvenient.  We'd like to add another directory for other modules.  To do this, you need to change the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  For this demonstration, I will make my `PYTHONPATH` environment variable the following (all as a single line):\n",

      "This means that the Python interpreter will first look in the present working directort to find a file with a name matching the import statement.  Next, it will look in the directory `/Users/Justin/bebi103`.  This would be a directory where I will keep all of my modules that I write for this class.  Then, it will look in the place where Canopy keeps its own packages.  Finally, I also include `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` because I have some packages in there that are not part of Canopy.\n",

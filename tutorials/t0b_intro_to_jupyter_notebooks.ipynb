    "##What is Jupyter?\n",
    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) is a way to combine text (with math!) and code (which runs and can display graphic output!) in an easy-to-read document that renders in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is language agnostic as its name suggests.  The name \"Jupyter\" is a combination of [Julia](http://julialang.org/) (a new language for scientific computing), [Python](http://python.org/) (which you know and love, or at least will when the course is over), and [R](https://www.r-project.org) (the dominant tool for statistical computation).  However, you currently can run over 40 different languages in a Jupyter notebook, not just Julia, Python, and R."

    "A Jupyter was spawned from the IPython project, Jupyter notebooks are still launched under the old name, \"IPython notebook.\"  To launch a Jupyter notebook, you can do the following.\n",
    "* **Mac**: Use the Anacondona launcher and select IPython notebook.\n",
    "* **Windows**: Under \"Search programs and files\" from the Start menu, type `ipython notebook` and select \"IPython notebook.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "    ipython notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "on the command line and hit enter.  This also allows for greater flexibility, as you can launch Jupyter with command line flags.  For example, I launch Jupyter using\n",
    "\n",
    "    ipython notebook --profile=custom --browser=safari\n",
    "\n",
    "This loads my custom formatting (more on that later) and uses Safari as the browser.  If you launch Jupyter from the command line, your shell will be occupied with Jupyter and will occasionally print information to the screen.  After you are finished with your Jupyter session (and have saved everything), you can kill Jupyter by hitting `ctrl-C` in the terminal/PowerShell window.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you launch  Jupyter, you will be presented with a menu of files in your current working directory to choose to edit.  You can also navigate around the files on your computer to find a file you wish to edit by clicking the \"Upload\" button in the upper right corner.  You can also click \"New\" in the upper right corner to get a new Jupyter notebook.  After selecting the file you wish to edit, it will appear in a new window in your browser, beautifully formatted and ready to edit."

    "\n",
    "A code cell contains actual code that you want to run.  You can specify a cell as a code cell using the pulldown menu in the toolbar in your Jupyter notebook.  Otherwise, you can can hit `esc` and then `y` (denoted \"`esc, y`\") while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell.  Note that you will have to hit enter after doing this to start editing it.\n",

    "If you want to execute the code in a code cell, hit `shift + enter`.  Note that code cells are executed in the order you execute them.  That is to say, the ordering of the cells for which you hit `shift + enter` is the order in which the code is executed.  If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are now known to the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells contain text.  The text is written in **markdown**, a lightweight markup language.  You can read about its syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  Note that you can also insert HTML into markdown cells, and this will be rendered properly.  As you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text.  Hitting `shift + enter` renders the text in the formatting you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify a cell as being a markdown cell in the Jupyter toolbar, or by hitting `esc, m` in the cell.  Again, you have to hit enter after using the quick keys to bring the cell into edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when you want to add a new cell, you can use the \"Insert\" pulldown menu from the Jupyter toolbar.  The shortcut to insert a cell below is `esc, b` and to insert a cell above is `esc, a`.  Alternatively, you  can execute a cell and automatically add a new one below it by hitting `alt + enter`."

It is particularly well-suited for beautiful typesetting of mathematical expressions.  In Jupyter notebooks, the $\\LaTeX$  mathematical input is rendered using software called MathJax.  This is run off of a server, so if you are not connected to the internet, your equations will not be rendered.  You will use $\\LaTeX$ extensively in preparation of your assignments.  There are plenty of resources on the internet for getting started with $\\LaTeX$, but you will only need a tiny subset of its functionality in your assignments, and this tutorial, plus cheat sheets you may find by Google (such as [this one](http://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf)) are useful."

    "### Problem 3.2: Dorsal gradients in *Drosophila* embryos (50 pts)\n",
    "We will use a data set from [Angela Stathopoulos's lab](http://www.stathlab.caltech.edu), acquired to study morphogen profiles in developing fruit fly embryos.  The original paper is [Reeves, Trisnadi, et al., Dorsal-ventral gene expression\n",

    "In this experiment, Reeves, Trisnadi, and coworkers measured expression levels of a fusion of Dorsal, a morphogen transcription factor important in determining the dorsal-ventral axis of the developing organism, and Venus, a yellow fluorescent protein along the dorsal/ventral- (DV) coordinate.  They put this construct on the third chromosome, while the wild type *dorsal* is on the second.  Instead of the wild type, they had a homozygous *dorsal*-null mutant on the second chromosome.  The Dorsal-Venus construct rescues wild type behavior, so they could use this construct to study Dorsal gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dorsal shows higher expression on the ventral side of the organism, thus giving a *gradient* in expression from dorsal to ventral which can be ascertained by the spatial distribution of Venus fluorescence intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be seen in the image below, which is a cross section of a fixed embryo with anti-Dorsal staining.  The bottom of the image is the ventral side and the top is the dorsal side of the embryo.  The DV coordinate system is defined by the yellow line.  It is periodic, going from $-1$ to $1$.  The DV-coordinate is therefore defined in relative terms around the embryo and is dimensionless.  The ventral nuclei show much higher expression of Dorsal.  The image is adapted from the Reeves, Trisnadi, et al. paper."

    "*A quick note on nomenclature:* Dorsal (capital D) is the name of the protein product of the gene *dorsal* (italicized).  The dorsal (adjective) side of the embryo is its back.  The ventral side is its belly.  Dorsal is expressed more strongly on the ventral side of the developing embryo.  This can be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the gradient, Reeves, Trisnadi, and coworkers had to first choose a metric for describing it.  They chose to fit the measured profile of fluorescence intensity with a Gaussian (plus background) and use the standard deviation of that Gaussian as a metric for the width of the Dorsal gradient.  This provides a nice motivation for doing nonlinear regression.\n",

    "Upon unzipping the data sets, you will find the file `reeves_dv_profile_over_time.csv`.  This contains the measured level of fluorescence intensity coming from the Dorsal-Venus construct at different stages of development.  Timing of development in the *Drosophila* embryo based on *nuclear cycles*, the number of nuclear divisions that have happened since fertilization.  Prior to cellularization of the syncytium, there are 14 rounds of nuclear division.  Reeves, Trisnadi, et al. measured Dorsal-Venus expression at nuclear cycle 11, 12, 13, and 14."

These data are contained in the file `reeves_gradient_width_various_methods.csv`.  Be sure to read the comments describing the data.  Generate a plot summarizing these data.  Discuss your choice for how you chose to render your plot.  Based on what you see, is the Venus fusion a reasonable way to study the Dorsal gradient, as compared to the wild type cross-section gold standard?"

    "\n",
    "A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that causes host organisms to develop a weaker, and sometimes ineffective, immune system. HIV inserts its viral RNA into a target cell of the immune system.  This virus gets reverse transcribed into DNA and integrated into the host cell's chromosomes.  The host cell will then transcribe the integrated DNA into mRNA for the production of viral proteins and produce new HIV.  Newly created viruses then exit the cell by budding off from the host.  HIV carries the danger of ongoing replication and cell infection without termination or immunological control.  Because CD4 T cells, which communicate with other immune cells to activate responses to foreign pathogens, are the targets for viral infection and production, their infection leads to reductions in healthy CD4 T cell production, causing the immune system to weaken.  This reduction in the immune response becomes particularly concerning after remaining infected for longer periods of time, leading to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n",

    "Perelson and coworkers have developed mathematical models to study HIV populations in the eukaryotic organisms.  HIV-1 will infect cells at a rate $k$ and is produced from these infected T cells at a rate $p$.  On the other hand, the viruses are lost due to clearance by the immune system of drugs, which occurs at a rate $c$, and infected cells die at a rate $\\delta$ (Figure from [Perelson, *Nat. Rev.
